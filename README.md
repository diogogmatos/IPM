# E. S. Ideal

> Internal service management platform, developed with Vue.js, TypeScript, and JSON Server.

This project was developed as a part of the Interface Pessoa-M√°quina (IPM), during the second semester of the Software Engineering Bachelors degree at University of Minho.

The objective was to create an internal management platform for the service station E. S. Ideal (Esta√ß√£o de Servi√ßo Ideal) that allowed station mechanics of different specialities to handle all the requested services quickly and easily. The main focus was to create a user-friendly interface that followed good practices strictly and implemented principles like the _Shneiderman‚Äôs 8 Golden Rules_, the _Nielsen Heuristics_ and other common guidelines.

## Setup

### Prerequisites: 
Ensure you have Node.js (version 14 or later) and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.

#### **CORS Everywhere**
In order to connect the _frontend_ to the _backend_ locally, it's necessary to enable CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) functionality. For security reasons, _browsers_ restrict HTTP _Cross Origin_ requests initiated by web pages. To allow them for development purposes, you should use this [Firefox addon](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cors-everywhere/).

### Install Dependencies
Navigate to the project directory and run the following command in your terminal to install the required dependencies:
```
npm install
```

## Compiling and Runnning
Simply run `npm-run-all` to automatically execute all necessary programs.
