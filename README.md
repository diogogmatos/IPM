# E.S. Ideal

> Internal service management platform, developed with Vue.js, TypeScript, and JSON Server.

This project was developed as part of the Interface Pessoa-M√°quina (IPM) subject during the second semester of the Software Engineering Bachelor's degree at the University of Minho.

The objective was to create an internal management platform for the service station E.S. Ideal (Esta√ß√£o de Servi√ßo Ideal) that allowed station mechanics of different specialties to handle all requested services quickly and easily. The main focus was to create a user-friendly interface that strictly followed good practices and implemented principles like Shneiderman‚Äôs 8 Golden Rules," "Nielsen Heuristics," and other common guidelines.

The actual implementation seen here was preceded by the development of the user-interface prototype in **Figma**, which you can check out [here](https://www.figma.com/design/PxCISzPiymy9MbwOunxaFW/ESIdeal?node-id=0%3A1&t=j4vPrKGpFEGI9uQU-1).

## Setup

### Prerequisites: 
Ensure you have Node.js (version 14 or later) and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.

#### **CORS Everywhere**
In order to connect the _frontend_ to the _backend_ locally, it's necessary to enable CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) functionality. For security reasons, _browsers_ restrict HTTP _Cross Origin_ requests initiated by web pages. To allow them for development purposes, you should use this [Firefox addon](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cors-everywhere/).

### Install Dependencies
Navigate to the project directory and run the following command in your terminal to install the required dependencies:
```
npm install
```

## Compiling and Runnning
Simply run `npm-run-all` to automatically execute all necessary programs.
